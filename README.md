## C++ Practice Programs 🚀

Welcome to my C++ Practice Repository! 👨‍💻
This repo contains my personal practice programs where I explore and learn Structured Programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts step by step.

# 📚 What You’ll Find Here

Basic C++ programs (to refresh concepts)

OOP programs using classes & objects

Examples of constructors, destructors, and copy constructors

More advanced C++ topics coming soon... InshaAllah ✨

# 🎯 Goal

I am practicing and improving my coding skills daily.
The aim is to build a strong foundation in C++ and OOP before moving toward Data Structures, Algorithms, and beyond.

# 🛠 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-practice.git


Open any file in your favorite IDE or editor (VS Code, Dev-C++, CodeBlocks).

Compile & run using:

g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

# 📌 Upcoming

Function Overloading & Operator Overloading

Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel)

Polymorphism (Virtual Functions)

File Handling in C++

Mini Projects 🚀
